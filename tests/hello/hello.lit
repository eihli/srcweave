# A Literate Hello, World!

## Introduction

A "Hello, World" program is one which simply outputs this text.
It originally cames from the book ["The C Programming Language"][c-programming]
and has since become the traditional first program to implement when learning a new programming language.

Here is a literate "Hello, World!".

## Implementation in C

We can define codeblocks with `---`.

--- hello world
printf("Hello, World!\n");
---

Blocks can then refer to one another to be included.
For example, all C programs need a main function.

--- /hello.c
@{includes}

int main() {
    @{hello world}
    return 0;
}
---

We need to include `stdio.h` to use the `printf` function.

--- includes
#include <stdio.h>
---

Blocks can also be referred to in prose.
For example @{includes}.
