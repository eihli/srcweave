# Unused block

An unused block should display a warning, but no errors.

--- unused block
Hello
---

Including an unknown block should also be a warning, whether it's
in prose, like @{undefined block} or in the code.

--- including undefined
Hello @{undefined block}
---

File blocks (prefixed with `/`) are terminal.
These blocks are never "unused" as they produce a file, so no warning should be produced.

--- /used block.txt
@{including undefined}
---
