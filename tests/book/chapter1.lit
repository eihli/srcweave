# Chapter 1

## Introduction

This is chapter which can contain blocks and reference blocks on other files and chapters.

## Vector

How do you implement a C++ vector class?
Let's give an overview and finish it off in the next chapter.

--- vector class
template<typename T>
struct vector2 {
    @{members}
    @{constructor}
    @{push back}
};
---

Size is how many elements are in the vector.
Capacity is how large the buffer is.
We have the invariant that `capacicty >= size`.

--- members
T* data;
size_t size;
size_t capacity;
---

## Constructor and destructor

Always need these.

--- constructor
vector2() : size(0), capacity(0), data(NULL) {}

~vector2() {
    if (data) free(data);
}
